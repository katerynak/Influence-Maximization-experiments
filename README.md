# Influence-Maximization-experiments
Experimental setup &amp; output for Influence Maximization repository

Each folder corresponds to an experiment or a group of experiments. Each contains
in/ directory, where input .json files can be found with all the input parameters, 
and output/ directory, where the outputs of correspondent input files can be found.

An example of how the experiments are structured and how they can be executed is provided
in example_experiment. 

Note: when trying to execute old experiments some of them may cause errors 
since the input parameters changed since they were executed. You can find source code revision numbers of
the execution of each of them in the correspondent output folders.
